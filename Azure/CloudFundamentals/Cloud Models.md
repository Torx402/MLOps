## Private Cloud

Private cloud refers to a type of data center that is only for the company to use, it is not shared with other entities. You can imagine this as a company having a data center located in a special dedicated place just for it. This means that they are responsible for everything, the physical hardware, software, and everything in between.

## Public Cloud

A public cloud, unlike a private one, is built to service any client who is willing to pay. A third party usually takes on all the tasks related to maintenance and physical security of the data center, and charges a fee to any client that needs its services, clients include anyone from the public.

## Hybrid Cloud

A hybrid cloud is one which provides the best of both worlds. This combines private and public cloud to make use of their advantages, the privacy of sensitive services and expandability of public ones.

## Multi-Cloud

This solution is basically a composition of multiple cloud services and cloud types, such as combining AWS with Azure or Google Cloud.
