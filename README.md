This repo documents the learning process of MLOps (Machine Learning Operations). This uses the [MLOps Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mlops-machine-learning-duke) course by Duke University on Coursera as a skeleton and tries to combine knowledge from external sources to provide a bigger picture about what MLOps is, and what is involved in it. 

The repo consists of notes which are written in the form of Markdown (.md) files. For the best experience, I recommend cloning the repo and opening it as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). 

Additionally, there will be Python scripts related to each task to demonstrate practically the topics that will be covered. Furthermore, the Projects folder will be used to demonstrate projects that will demonstrate a combination of multiple concepts and tools to show things can fit in together.

Finally, feel free to checkout the **Projects** folder, which will consist of projects that implement key concepts. Projects may or may not be related to the course, this varies from project to project.
